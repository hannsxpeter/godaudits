# Security Policy

## What this project is

godaudits is a prompt-engineering package: markdown instructions plus three
shell scripts (a POSIX sh installer, `install.sh`, and two bash maintenance
scripts, `scripts/build-prompt.sh` and `scripts/lint.sh`). It executes no
network calls, collects no data, and the skill itself instructs agents to
treat auditing as strictly read-only: no source edits, no app execution,
no live-system connections.

## Threat model relevant to users

- **Skill-content injection.** A skill's text becomes standing instructions
  for your agent session. Review `skills/godaudits/SKILL.md` before
  installing, as you should for any skill; this repository never asks the
  agent to bypass safety, exfiltrate data, or edit source during an audit.
- **Installer.** `install.sh` writes only into skill directories
  (`~/.agents/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, and equivalents) and removes only
  the `godaudits` entries it created. It never elevates, never curls, never
  evaluates remote content.
- **Supply chain.** Install from a pinned release tag or commit if your
  environment requires reproducibility: `git clone --branch v1.0.0`.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a way this skill's content or scripts could cause an agent to
take unsafe action, open a GitHub Security Advisory on this repository
(preferred) or a private report to the maintainer via GitHub. Please include
the harness (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, other), the exact file and lines,
and a reproduction. Expect an acknowledgment within 72 hours.

Please do not open public issues for exploitable findings before a fix
lands.
